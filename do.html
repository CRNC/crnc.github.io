<p>Our computational environments and infrastructure grow more
powerful, more heterogeneous, and more complicated.  Reproducibility
can be improved through practices and tools which establish efficient
management of data and scripts which also keep the history and details
of changes, and facilitation of analysis execution in a fashion that
they could later be inspected, compared, validated, adjusted or
expanded, and re-executed.
<br>To become most effective, such solutions
should consider all stages of the scientific process, from the
experiment planing and data collection, to publication of the
findings. We aim to assist neuroimaging community to improve
reproducibility of their results by <strong>Do</strong>ing</p>
<ul>
  <li>data conversion with minimal manual effort while establishing
    data provenance from the moment data are collected</li>
  <li>collection and analysis of data provenance at any step of the
    the scientific process</li>
  <li>(re)execution of (previous) analyses in scalable and flexible
  manner while gaining advantage of existing infrastructure and new
  technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We strongly believe in the benefits of modular design,
  collaboration, and re-use. That is why instead of developing a
  single monolithic platform to "solve all the problems", we are
  trying to reuse and contribute as much as possible to existing
  projects. To that end, in the scope of this project we actively
  maintain relevant software
  within <a href="http://neuro.debian.net">NeuroDebian</a> turnkey
  platform, so you could benefit from new solutions such
  as <a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov">Singularity</a> to make your
  research more flexible and reproducible. With our developments we
  aim to provide you with a collection of tools useful on their own
  even if you do not want to establish the full recommended chain of
  products.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we are focused on the following projects. You can help us
  by trying and starting to use them, contributing, or by sharing your
  ideas on how to improve them.  Only with your feedback (positive or
  negative) we could make our projects most beneficial
  for <strong>your</strong> research.

  Collect and prepare neuroimaging data in an efficient and automated
  way to immediately benefit from the established community
  standard <a href="http://bids.neuroimaging.io">Brain Imaging Data Structure
  (BIDS)</a>, and a <a href="http://datalad.org">Distributed data
  distribution and management system DataLad</a>. To achieve that we
</p>

<ul>
    <li>formalize
    a <a href="https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/heudiconv/heuristics/reproin.py">specification</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin/blob/master/docs/walkthrough-1.md">procedures</a>
    for MRI scanning to allow for flexible, automated, and
    non-ambiguous conversion of all acquired MR
    data from original DICOM files to BIDS dataset(s)</li>

    <li>contribute to the development of
    the <a href="http://github.com/nipy/heudiconv">Heuristic DICOM
    Converter (HeuDiConv)</a> which provides us the base
    implementation platform</li>

    <li>integrate with "lab notebook" suites such
    as <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/brainverse">BrainVerse</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Having all collected data automatically converted to BIDS, while
  retaining all original DICOMs as well with clear association between
  raw and converted data, makes it possible to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    validate and assess the quality of data acquisition by using
    the <a href="https://github.com/INCF/bids-validator">BIDS-validator</a>
    and <a href="http://mriqc.readthedocs.io">MRIQC</a> to detect
    possible problems with the design or acquisition in the earliest
    stages of a project and avoid many common mistakes stemming from
    manual data conversion and curation
  <li>
    automatically reconvert all collected data in case if relevant
    defects get detected in the conversion backend utility, or
    additional metadata stored in DICOMs found to be necessary, or
    possibly again to reconfirm reproducibility of the data itself
  </li>
  <li>
    make it possible to start data analysis immediately after
    collection using any of the BIDS-aware applications
  </li>
  <li>
	facilitate data sharing (private or public) and publication (data
	descriptor papers) since all data is immediate almost completely
	ready for sharing in a standardized files layout and annotation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Having all data under DataLad distributed version control makes it
  possible to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
	start changing and enriching BIDS dataset with information not
	available during scanning (condition onsets, dataset metadata in
	README etc), while allowing for subsequent updates and merges with
	new data coming from the scanner using standard git mechanisms
  </li>
  <li>
	distribute data for curation and processing across available
	infrastructure while relying on git-annex to maintain information
	about data availability, and git providing clear information about
	dataset version(s).
  </li>
  <li>
    annotate sensitive data files with metadata to automatically
    restrict their public sharing (e.g. original DICOMs, non-defaced anatomicals)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/NICEMAN">NICEMAN</a></h3>

<p>Neuroimaging Computation Environments Manager
  (<a href="http://niceman.repronim.org">NICEMAN</a>) intends to help
  researchers track and manage computation resources they have
  available and use, in a reproducible and scalable way.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Collection of information about used resources:
      software packages (Debian, Conda, pip), VCS repositories (git,
      svn), containers (docker, singularity), etc., possibly enriching
      already collected provenance information (e.g., obtained
      from <a href="http://www.reproducibleimaging.org/describe.html">BrainVerse</a>,
	  <a href="http://reprozip.org">ReproZip</a>, or workflow
      engines).  We make accent on collecting an exhaustive amount of
      information so it could be sufficient to later automatically
      re-instantiate necessary components given just a
      specification.</li>
    <li>Analyze collected information to be able to answer questions:
	  <ul>
		<li>Am I using the same software as in the original analysis?
		<li>What has changed?
		<li>Does a given environment satisfy necessary requirements?
	  </ul>
	</li>
    <li>When possible adjust any given computational environment to
        satisfy specified requirements, or just repopulate a new
        (docker, singularity, etc) container which would.</li>
    <li>Provide uniform interface to a variety of computational
        environments (containers, cloud, etc.) for interactive
        sessions and scheduling of computational tasks while allowing
        for tracing of computational resources used by the
        computation.</li>
