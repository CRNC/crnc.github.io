<p>Our computational environments and infrastructure grow more
powerful, more heterogeneous, and more complicated.  Reproducibility
can be improved through practices and tools which establish efficient
management of data and scripts which also keep the history and details
of changes, and facilitation of analysis execution in a fashion that
they could later be inspected, compared, validated, adjusted or
expanded, and re-executed.
<br>To become most effective, such solutions
should consider all stages of the scientific process, from the
experiment planing and data collection, to publication of the
findings. We aim to assist neuroimaging community to improve
reproducibility of their results by <strong>Do</strong>ing</p>
<ul>
  <li>data conversion with minimal manual effort while establishing
    data provenance from the moment data are collected</li>
  <li>collection and analysis of data provenance throughout different steps of
    the scientific process</li>
  <li>(re)execution of (previous) analyses in scalable and flexible
  manner while gaining advantage of existing infrastructure and new
  technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We strongly believe in the benefits of modular design,
  collaboration, and re-use. That is why instead of developing a
  single monolithic platform to "solve all the problems", we are as
  much as possible reuse and contribute to existing projects. To that
  end, in the scope of this project we actively maintain relevant
  software within <a href="http://neuro.debian.net">NeuroDebian</a>,
  so that ReproNim and other projects could benefit from this turnkey
  platform.  We also provided official Debian packaging and assist in
  maintaining
  <a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov">Singularity</a> "scientific
  containerization" platform to make your research more flexible and
  reproducible. With our ongoing software and platforms developments
  we aim to provide you with a collection of tools useful on their own
  even if you do not want to establish the full recommended chain of
  products.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we are focused on the following projects. You can help us
  by trying and starting to use them, contributing, or by sharing your
  ideas on how to improve them.  Only with your feedback (positive or
  negative) we could make our projects most beneficial
  for <strong>your</strong> research.

  Collect and prepare neuroimaging data in an efficient and automated
  way to immediately benefit from the established community
  standard <a href="http://bids.neuroimaging.io">Brain Imaging Data Structure
  (BIDS)</a>, and a <a href="http://datalad.org">Distributed data

</p>

<ul>
    <li>formalize
    a <a href="https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/heudiconv/heuristics/reproin.py">specification</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin/blob/master/docs/walkthrough-1.md">procedures</a>
    for MRI scanning to allow for flexible, automated, and
    non-ambiguous conversion of all acquired MR
    data from original DICOM files to BIDS dataset(s)</li>

    <li>contribute to the development of
    the <a href="http://github.com/nipy/heudiconv">Heuristic DICOM
    Converter (HeuDiConv)</a> which provides us the base
    implementation platform</li>

    <li>integrate with "lab notebook" suites such
    as <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/brainverse">BrainVerse</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Having all collected data automatically converted to BIDS, while
  retaining all original DICOMs as well with clear association between
  raw and converted data, makes it possible to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    validate and assess the quality of data acquisition by using
    the <a href="https://github.com/INCF/bids-validator">BIDS-validator</a>
    and <a href="http://mriqc.readthedocs.io">MRIQC</a> to detect
    possible problems with the design or acquisition in the earliest
    stages of a project and avoid many common mistakes stemming from
    manual data conversion and curation
  <li>
    automatically reconvert all collected data in case if relevant
    defects get detected in the conversion backend utility, or
    additional metadata stored in DICOMs found to be necessary, or
    possibly again to reconfirm reproducibility of the data itself
  </li>
  <li>
    make it possible to start data analysis immediately after
    collection using any of the BIDS-aware applications
  </li>
  <li>
	facilitate data sharing (private or public) and publication (data
	descriptor papers) since all data is immediate almost completely
	ready for sharing in a standardized files layout and annotation.
  </li>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/myyoda">YODA</a> Principles</h3>

<p>YODA (YODAâ€™s organigram on data analysis) is a an advisory for
  use of version control systems such as
  <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>,
  <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex</a>,
  and <a href="http://datalad.org">DataLad</a> in a modular fashion to
  cover the entire life-span of a research project with reliable,
  non-ambiguous tracking and orchestration of all digital products of
  a study (e.g., inputs, code, outputs). Modularization facilitates
  their independent re-use (e.g., the same data used across multiple
  studies; versions of a software library used repeatedly), and
  scaling to dataset sizes found in cutting edge high-resolution
  neuroimaging research.</p>

<p>
  In the scope of the ReproIn project, having all data collected as
  DataLad datasets makes it possible to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
	start changing and enriching BIDS dataset with information not
	available during scanning (condition onsets, dataset metadata,
	etc.), while allowing for subsequent updates and merges with new
	data coming from the scanner using standard git mechanisms
  </li>
  <li>
	distribute data for curation and processing across available
	infrastructure while relying on git-annex to maintain information
	about data availability, and git providing clear information about
	dataset version(s)
  </li>
  <li>
	annotate sensitive data files with metadata to automatically
	restrict their public sharing (e.g. original DICOMs, non-defaced anatomicals).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also extend and contribute new functionality
  to <a href="http://datalad.org">DataLad</a> to facilitate
  VCS-enabled provenance tracing of execution and results:
	<ul>
	  <li>
		<strong><a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/cmdline.html#reproducible-execution">run/rerun</a></strong>
	  see <a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/simple_provenance_tracking.html">DataLad
	  documentation on provenance tracking</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<strong><a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-addurls.html">addurls</a></strong>
		to produce DataLad dataset(s) from a set of structured data as
		in the <a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/simple_workflow">Simple
		Workflow</a> papers.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/ReproNim/NICEMAN">NICEMAN</a></h3>

<p>Neuroimaging Computation Environments Manager
  (<a href="http://niceman.repronim.org">NICEMAN</a>) is being
  developed to help researchers track and manage computation resources
  they have available and use in a reproducible and scalable way. We
  aim NICEMAN to</p>
<ul>
    <li>collect information about used resources: software packages
      (Debian, Conda, pip), VCS repositories (git, svn), containers
      (docker, singularity), etc., possibly enriching already
      collected provenance information (e.g., obtained
      from <a href="http://www.reproducibleimaging.org/describe.html">BrainVerse</a>,
	  <a href="http://reprozip.org">ReproZip</a>, or workflow
      engines).  We make accent on collecting an exhaustive amount of
      information so it could be sufficient to later automatically
      re-instantiate necessary components given just a
      specification.</li>
    <li>analyze collected information to answer questions:
	  <ul>
		<li>"Am I using the same software as in the original analysis?"
		<li>"What has changed?"
		<li>"Does a given environment satisfy necessary requirements?"
	  </ul>
	</li>
    <li>(when feasible) adjust any given computational environment to
        satisfy specified requirements, or just repopulate a new
        (docker, singularity, etc) container which would.</li>
    <li>provide uniform interface to a variety of computational
        environments (containers, cloud, etc.) for interactive
        sessions and scheduling of computational tasks while allowing
        for tracing of computational resources used by the
        computation.</li>
